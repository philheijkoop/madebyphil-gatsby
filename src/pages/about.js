            <p>This site talks mostly about stuff I've made, or things I learned while building stuff. </p>
            <p>My name is Phil Heijkoop, I'm a Dutchman living in New England. I grew up all over the world, since my father was a diplomat and we would move to a new post ever few years. After I graduated from high school in Brussels, I went to college at the TU Delft to study mechanical engineering (with a focus on robotics). </p>
            <p>I spent a lot of time in the Dutch lacrosse community, coaching and starting my own club team (the Delft Barons), playing on the national team from 2009-2012, and eventually using that connection to move to Munich, Germany in 2016 to do my graduate research in multi-robot SLAM at DLR (Germany Aerospace Center). I met a girl there (who I later married), that encouraged me to stick around. We moved back to the US in 2018.</p>
            <p>Now I am the head of solutions at ALM Works (now a part of Tempo), the creators of Structure for Jira, the premier project and portfolio management app for Jira. I am part of the business development leadership team, working for customers as well as on internal processes to maintain our culture of excellence as we grow. I present (a lot) for customers and our partners in the Atlassian ecosystem, so keep an eye out for that.</p>
            <p>I'm a jack-of-all-trades, ostensibly an expert in project, portfolio and product management at scale, with an interest in entrepreneurship and how companies can grow (this will become very obvious if you read through the books I publish notes on) and be successful. I love wearing different hats in my role and switching between support, product management, engineering, sales, marketing, etc. I know enough about all those things to be dangerous.</p>
