Kathy starts with a situation where someone wants to start a startup and assumes users will help fund for its growth and development.

She starts with asserting that we don't really want customers to engage with the brand we're building, that's not the goal.

Similar to gamification, that element of conditioning and loyalty programs aren't doing what we think they are. They're bribery with elements and it's not a sustainable mechanism (unless you're AmEx or Visa, but even then it's more a customer acquisition strategy).

Again, loyalty is also not the goal.

> We want to be sustainably desirable without having to bribe, incentivize, or coerce our customers.

A lot of people assume quality products will lead to increased desirability. But that's not inherently true. The world is full of "great product, didn't sell".

The entire premise is flawed, since only the user can determine quality and desirability.

In fact, it goes further, users will tolerate a lot of crap for the apps they really love. And they really love them usually for a single reason.

If things are really desirable, they'll even reinterpret crap as desirable.

What we really want is word of mouth, especially between trusted sources (friends, family, etc).

So we need fewer ads and more recommendations from real users.

Driving Word of Mouth, most people compete in trying to get the users to say "the product is awesome", "the company is awesome" or "the service is awesome", but that's not really the real reason people think it's awesome. That's what marketing companies want them to say in testimonials. What we really want is something that makes the user think "this makes ME awesome".

What we shouldn't do, is try to get our company to be perceived as awesome, when the user in fact is trying to be awesome themselves. That's the saddest Venn diagram.

> **So compete on User Awesome, not App Awesome**

> The key attribute of a successful app don't live in the app. they live in the user of the app being successful.!

Focusing on making the user awesome, allows you to get away with not being the best at other things. It also allows you to allocate resources according.

"Awesome" means the user becomes a badass, something in what they want to accomplish. What THEY care about.

So they aren't using your app because they like the app, they use it because they like themselves and who they become with it.

This is not luck.

> "Point of View" is worth 80 IQ points

Customer service is a trap too, people don't want to be treated like a puppy, they want to be a badass.

Right now the focus is on what can we make the user badass AT.

So even if you have a small tool, focus on what it enables.

They don't want to be killer at final cut pro, they want to make killer videos.

She brings up the slide again where marketing shows slick and sexy pictures of a user making awesome pictures, but then the post-sale material is super dry and boring and focuses again on the camera and not HOW TO USE the camera to be that awesome photographer.

Think of it in terms of what the bigger, greater thing you are enabling with your product for the customer.

> A great way to think of this is what is your ideal amazon review for a book, if it mentions the author or book, you're doing it wrong. It should talk about what the reviewer got from it!

What actually matter is what happens AFTER the user interaction with your product is done.

Becoming badass requires 3 things:

1. Models - examples of what success is
2. edge practice - deliberate practice
3. forward flow - an inherent motivation to proceed

While there are true research papers, it's best to read Drive by Daniel Pink and The Talent Code by Daniel Coyle to get a good overview of it.

So putting above into practice, if you could do only 1 thing for your users, you should provide repeated exposure to the performance, process, and results of badass users (this helps with the models part)

The corollary is also true, giving them lots of examples of what not great looks like (especially if that's their own mediocre and unguided practice in your product) engrains what mediocre looks like and makes that the expectation.

If you can only do 2 things for our users, add a progressive series of exercises, each designed to build a fine-grained skill within 1-3 sessions. Find a way to make them about 90% reliable at being good at the skill they need (so not a tutorial, but deliberate practice) within 1-3 sessions or 45 minutes of work. High-quality, low-latency feedback. Together with fine-grained skill.

If you can only do 3 things for your users, add a clear, believable map of progression from novice to mastery. A good example of this is how martial arts signal this. A motivational GPS to keep them moving forward, especially when it gets tough.

Considering that all elements of concentration, willpower, focus, self-control, etc are all coming from the same bucket, so draining one hampers the ability to use another soon after, you should practice "cognitive-resource-driven design".

You need to address all cognitive resource leaks. Choice overload is something to address.
