Kathy addresses the alleged business model of:

1. Get Users
2. ???
3. Profit

Where there isn't just a huge problem with step 2, but step 1 isn't exactly trivial either. Instead of focusing on being viral or being lovable, her thesis is that the best predictor for success is helping the users be awesome. And when the users are passionate about their abilities with your product/service, then you're cooking with gas.

We shouldn't focus on the tool, what the tool does or what it does for the user, but the actual results the users get out of it.

This is something you should build your business model around. An example:

> Having a point and shoot camera, Nikon shows you on their site how to take amazing photos, they basically show you how to capture an amazing waterfall with shutter speed control. So the users have now sold themselves on the need for a camera with shutter speed control. However, the next hurdle would be the manual, so you need to make sure the entire journey is there.

So the documentation (ie the stuff about the tool) isn't lining up with the marketing (which is all about what the user wants to do).

To address the concern that it would potentially push someone to a rival company â†’ brains generally attribute the person who aroused the desire with the ones who can deliver it, not just what, but **_who_.**

The better we understand a topic, the more value we can derive from messaging. So a rock climber sees paths, handholds, dangers, etc. where a regular person just sees a mountain. They have a richer, deeper experience looking at topics. That's where you should focus your messaging on, because those that are looking to get deeper value (and be better users).

**Don't make a better [x], make a better [user of x].**

You would like to have word of mouth, but even better would be what she calls word of obvious, something that doesn't even need to be said.

> She has an example where she was a novice horse rider, but she got an expensive saddle. To other horse riders, they could see her improvement and had already ordered the saddle so it could help them. She didn't have to say anything, to those in the know it was obvious.

There are a lot of ways to make our message about what the users can now do more compelling. Instead of talking about the features, we should be talking about the benefits. We can improve how we convey that by using various "hack" to get the brain to pay attention, all of them focus on the emotional response we are trying to elicit.

**Focus on what the user does, not what you do**

Or better phrased:

**We help $type_of_person by awesome at $thing**

There were several other examples of how companies have used visceral reactions to grab the reader/user's attention and then used that to reel them in further. One guiding example was the phrase from Electric Rain "User must do something cool within 30 minutes" and that guided all they did.

Offer them better gear - and help them justify that. They'll feel like they have god-like powers, but others may just see pixels. Sometimes the user needs to justify the time and money they spend to others too.

What you want to end up doing is motivating and inspiring users to do things they already want to do, but aren't. It's not generally about getting them to do something they don't want to do, but they are stuck for some reason in a mode that they want to get out of but don't know how to.

One of the challenges of helping adequate users get to the point of passion, is to help them make sure the effort of becoming a novice is worth it. That they won't fall into an emotional backslide where they feel like something is hard or they aren't good at it.

**Make the right thing easy and the wrong thing difficult.**

This is a great mantra for UI design too. Sometimes it's a very minor tweak.

There's also motivation in trying to belong to a user group. Think about what does it say about your user that they are your user.

> Think Different is a great example. Counter example would be if it says it was free or it was easy. Or it says nothing at all.

Experts use patterns to their advantage. You can give your users patterns that shortens the 10000 hours they need to be or feel like experts. This of course assumes you can articulate the patterns. You can also help them get to 10000 hours by shortening the time it takes them to get there by making it easier to practice.

This means exercises that also force repeated use of good practices.

You should make it easy for users to be confused and tell us. If they are making the confused face in front of a human we would proactively help them. Help and FAQ are not helpful, because they are designed for passively intellectually curious, not when they want to say "WTF".

> If you want them to RTFM then make a better FM.

If you pretend the user is on a hero's journey, who are you to them on that journey (Yoda, Aragorn, or Jabba the Hutt).

A great example is the problem with "no dumb questions", because that doesn't help good answers. "No dumb answer" is a better policy, since it removes any vitriol from "Read the fucking archive" type answers.
