Seth starts with the premise that if no one knows about your product (sliced bread story), your product will fail.

> Ideas that spread, win

So everyone's job is about spreading ideas. It's not about function.

Ideas will spread far and wide, even without function. See all the viral hoaxes.

> Godin's 1st law of software: If you're going to build software, if you haven't built in the marketing, don't bother.

Software that connects, spreads. If you don't have mechanisms inside your tool that make it easy to share and get others to use it to get the value out of the original user using it, you won't get those network effects.

In general, because of the way broad advertising works, lots of companies focus on average products for average people.

If your customers aren't looking, they don't see you. So you are invisible if you don't make a product that's highly visible to those searching.

There's a huge amount of clutter and variety in stores, or web search. The vast majority of people won't care enough to find out how yours is better.

You can see this in action as most people work for companies that make more products to keep up with this clutter, thus adding more to the problem.

He asserts that the marketing department's goals is based on hoping people see our ad, are caught in their tracks as if Medusa hit them with her freeze stare and immediately buy, but we are so accustomed to it, that we don't. We walk by ads that cost millions of dollars to create all the time without batting an eye. So a lot of marketing is more like spam.

What the goal should be is to be remarkable, to be so good that you compel one human to talk to another human about your product. In order to do that, you need to be doing a lot of things differently.

His other assertion is that we are all in the business of taking things that are good enough and changing them to be interesting enough to be talked about. The margins is where the profit is at. Mass market is no longer what you want to target, too much competition.

You should be mindful about the medium that you are going to be living and marketing in, and build FOR that world.

There's a lot of new trends that you can use to inform your strategic decisions:

- There is an increased tendency of direct to consumer connections which is great for cutting out expensive middle men
  - Sonos cut out custom installers and high end audio manufacturers by selling directly to consumers and making it REALLY easy to order and install
- This same logic applies to complaints. Every consumer is now potentially equally loud
  - A comcast installer falls asleep on someone's couch, that being recorded and put on youtube will cost comcast A LOT to fix.
  - The taco bell complaint website that sends a copy to the CEO and the health department, run by a disgruntled customer
- Given the choice, people take the choice. Even if they only want the stuff available everywhere
- Another thing that's growing now is that users will pick their own media channels (whether it's google or an influencer)
- Users can now also connect to other users. Consumers connect to other consumers. Whether that's p2p sharing of thoughts, reviews, or two-sided marketplaces.
- With all this, we can also choose who we target. So instead of targeting a broader audience, we can target the right audience.
- While the gulf between rich or poor is growing, so is the number of rich people. So there is a growing amount of people out there who can AND will pay for bespoke things (or stuff that seems bespoke).
- Gatekeepers to decision makers are different now than they used to be. Easiest to understand this if you are one.

Another interesting thing he points to is the Seinfeld curve. You make money by being either ubiquitous or (artificially) scarce/bespoke, nothing in the middle. You can watch Seinfeld anywhere for free on day time TV, YouTube, etc. You can watch Jerry Seinfeld live for $250 a show in Vegas and you need to fly there. There is no $90 Seinfeld experience.

> The TLDR is that you should not think about it as "how do I find customers for my products", but that you need to start thinking of "how you can build products for your customers"

Share of wallet is easier than share of market. So once you have a trusted relationship with the customers, it's easier to build on that.

You need to commit to stuff before seeing success.

As an aside: I went to Seth's website, Squidoo and it's now just a scummy front for a course on how to make money working from home.
