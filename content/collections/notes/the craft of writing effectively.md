The writing program was created to help the readers of writing at UChicago, ie the faculty. People are often resistant to work on their writing, because everyone assumes it’s a basic skill and so the course is remedial, but this is not true.

It is against rule-governed training for writing. Start focusing on the readers. It assumes that the writer is an expert in the subject on which they are communicating. So a lot of your thoughts are things that haven’t been thought before.

You are thus often using your writing process to help you think. The common practice of creating an outline first, then writing the paper is an example of how this works for simple tasks like in High School, but is no longer applicable when you haven’t finished thinking about the topic when you first start to write. In fact, if you don’t do this, you are probably not thinking at the level you need to be thinking at (distilling abstract thoughts into the framework of language).

This presents a different set of challenges than for example a journalist who is doing more of a transcription operation than a creation/distillation process.

When you write about something you are describing how you see the world in a new way, you send it to a reader and if you have done your job correctly, it changes how they see the world.

The most common challenge is you write in a certain pattern to help you think, but you have not written in the pattern that will allow readers to consume your ideas properly. When you do this, the reader slows down and eventually stops. People will only put in this effort when they need to read the content. When they don’t NEED to read the material, they won’t put in the effort and so won’t read it.

In the hierarchy of why writing isn’t having the impact people need it to have, it needs to be clear, organized, persuasive but above all else, it needs to be VALUABLE to the reader. If it isn’t, then the rest doesn’t matter.

- Valuable
- Persuasive
- Organized
- Clear

And a major problem with deconstructing that challenge is the assumption that value lies in the world, but it should be with the reader. Each good text should have an audience that thinks it is valuable, if you don’t write FOR that audience you will miss the mark. So you need to START with thinking about your intended audience, then work from there.

Another common habit that you need to unlearn is explaining something to demonstrate you understand it, like people have done in school. The goal should be to change the readers’ ideas. In many cases your readers have the professional function (and capability) to challenge your ideas. So explanation only happens in the valuable and persuasive realm (but not in organized and clear).

Another misconception is that you’re creating new knowledge, if that isn’t valuable, it’s still pointless. Most people assume they live in a world where they can just add to some ‘pile’ of knowledge, and as soon as they find something new it’s automatically valuable. But in reality that’s not the case, they need to ensure that that new knowledge is considered valuable by a very specific public (can be PhD committee, can be customers, can be voters, etc).

A great exercise would be to go through articles in your field, and circle every word in the article that creates value to the reader. It’s a code, and it often is community-dependent.

An essay is designed to help a specific set of readers understand better something they want to understand well.

Your relationship to your knowledge is that of the farmer to the wheat and the miner to the coal, it is a means to which you can produce value for others and yourself. Your ability to generate that value for others is how your abilities will be measured.

Using terms like “anomaly”, “inconsistent”, “but”, “although”, and “however” are means to create tension or instability in the knowledge that the reader has.

So when you are trying to address a problem, make sure it is framed in terms of a problem that your reading community cares about. That means your thesis needs to include the problem statement before you can ‘sell’ anyone on your solution to it.
