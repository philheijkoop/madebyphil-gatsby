You can't improve what you don't measure. Your metrics will change depending on the stage you're in. They are great ways to align your team, since people will work to improve the metrics.

Your goal should be having your Growth Rate (% YoY) + Operating profit (% of revenue) be greater than 40. This is the key driver of SaaS valuations.

Key startup growth goals should focus on building a repeatable, scalable and profitable growth machine.

A key indicator would be that your bookings are growing quarter over quarter, leading to exponential growth of ARR. So what's the best way to measure SaaS bookings:

Net New ARR = New ARR (new customers) + Expansion ARR (existing customers) - Churned ARR (lost customers)

It's a good idea to chart all 4 of those components on the same chart over time to make sure you see growth.

Simple way to look at this would be to see the funnel.

At the top you see Lead Flow, which is the amount of leads coming in. You multiple them by your conversion rate and your average deal size and you have your booking rate.

Early on in your SaaS journey, you should be focusing mostly on Lead Flow and Conversion rate, not so much on average deal size.

For the self-serve option where people land on your site, they try a demo and then you hope to close them. They key metrics here are:

Visitors, then trials, then closed rates. Plotted again you can see which ones grow. You also have an easy conversion % from this, **as long as you do this by cohort!**

This allows you to segment by lead source and you find your lead sources that you should lean into.

For sales people, there are two limitations to keep in mind when working with sales folks. They have a ramp up time, and a capacity limit on how many deals they can properly work over time (increasing beyond that will cost you).

Growth therefore will come in discontinuous jumps and if we don't have enough sales folks, we limit our own growth rate.

You can get your bookings number now by multiplying sales people by their productivity per rep (PPR). The most common reasons for missing sales targets is by not hiring sales people fast enough. So this is one where you can't delay hiring.

PPR is impacted by the quality of sales hires (David insists you need to bring recruiting in-house for this) and the quality of onboarding and training. This is a key skill for success.

You should track average PPR on a timeseries graph to make sure it's growing, as well as graphing all your sales folks and their above or below quota quarters. If you see the latest quarter with people exceeding quotas it means your onboarding and hiring is working.

You should also see if at least 75% of your reps are at least hitting 75% of their quotas, and 50% should be exceeding their quotas altogether.

In order to figure out if our funnel is profitable, we need to see the customer LTV is significantly greater than the CAC.

Customer lifetime is 1/ customer churn rate

There's a difference between dollar churn and customer churn, track them both.

You can get negative dollar churn if you are successfully expanding revenue from existing customers faster than you are losing revenue from customers leaving.

In order to get upsell opportunities, you need to find ways to get variable pricing. It's a secondary thing, so not crucial for early stage, but you can expand pricing by having feature tiers, usage tiers, or user tiers.

Negative churn is crucial to ensure you are still growing.

One of the challenges of funded growth of SaaS companies is that you get the cashflow trough. Which means your customers cost you money for the first few months (so increasing customer growth also means a deeper trough.

With this early stage negative signal, how do you know your business will turn the corner? You should have a LTV > 3x CAC and you should need less than 12-18 months payback period to recover CAC (this is for capital efficiency).

Using unit economics will also let you evaluate the CAC to LTV ratio of various customer segments and channels.

You should also track these per sales rep, for example if they want to make 100k OTE, then you should set their target at roughly 4-6x that.

If you manage to allow people to pay a year in advance instead of monthly, you can eliminate the entire cash flow trough (which isn't uncommon with enterprise SaaS).
