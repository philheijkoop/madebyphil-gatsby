#### By George S Clason

I finished this book after reading _Rich Dad, Poor Dad_. It reiterates a lot of the advice, though it's told in the vein of old-timey stories from Babylon. The wisdom in this book is fairly self-evident, but it's always good to have it repeated.

- Put aside 10% of your income for long-term wealth generation
- Work hard, sometimes it pays off, other times it helps you be a hard worker so you're ready for when hard work can pay off.
- Pay your debts, running from them only makes it worse in the long run.
- Only invest in things you understand, and when you don't understand an area of investment, ask an expert you trust for advice.

There isn't a lot else to say, the book is easy to read and can be finished in a couple of hours. Similar to _RDPD_ its advice is good if you hadn't heard it before, but otherwise it's just stating the obvious.
