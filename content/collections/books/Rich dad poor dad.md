#### By Robert Kiyosaki

This book was the first I read in my aspiration to read a list of 50 popular books on the topics of finance, wealth, business and psychology.

I had heard about this book a lot in my reading of various subreddits and blog posts. It was a short book, 131 pages long in PDF format, so I got through it fairly quickly. It has a light style, easily digestible chapters and no overly complex subject matters.

The chapters each center on a lesson which the author hopes to relay to the reader as a means of increasing their financial IQ. They're told as lessons the author received from his friend's father growing up, the eponymous 'rich dad', where his own father is the 'poor dad'. The summary is quite simple, to be wealthy, it is best to spend your money on assets (ie real estate, stocks, and other items that will put your money to work earning you more money) vs liabilities (ie a home, expensive cars, and other doodads).

Reading a chapter an evening allowed me to digest the material and think on it piecemeal, which helped. A lot of the concepts in the book are fairly obvious in hindsight and the lessons are worth knowing. I'm curious to explore two elements the book focused on more deeply; using a corporation to take advantage of the tax structure in the US and pay for certain things before you are taxed, and learning to read financial and accounting statements.

All in all, I think it was a useful book to read. A summary could have achieved the same effect, but taking each lesson and reflecting on how I am implementing it, want to implement it, or am doing the opposite (which I am in some cases) was helpful from a self-audit perspective.
