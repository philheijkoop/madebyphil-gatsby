#### By Gene Kim, Kevin Behr, George Spafford

The notes for this book will be a little different from the regular notes. I ‘read’ this one on Audible in the form of an audiobook. This precludes my taking notes while I read it the first time through and summarizing them at the end of each chapter, since I normally was driving to and from work when I listened to it.

The book was an entertaining read, it’s a narrative that aims to explain how a company could put the principles of DevOps into practice and how much IT operations has to learn from lean manufacturing. However because I work in the Agile space and mostly in smaller companies, a lot of the problems the main character ran into I associate with companies that are very behind. As a developer that started his career closer to 2010 than 2000, DevOps was already partially a concept in my working life.

However, I did find the book to be interesting, easy to follow and probably still very relevant to folks who work in larger companies that struggle with Agility and general IT challenges. In fact, I had several conversations with folks who consult for enterprise companies that were describing SAFe based solutions to problems and they could certainly benefit from a less heavy-handed approach to start.

All in all an interesting read, it was quick too, the characters were fairly flat but that didn’t detract from the main purpose. It did also point me to a book I am curious to add to my to-read backlog: Beyond the Goal: theory of constraints by Eliyahu Goldratt (I got it as an audiobook as well, but hopefully I can take slightly better notes as I consume it).
