#### Ryan Serhant

This book is about a guy who moved to NYC and became one of the best selling real estate agents there (allegedly). His book is full of strategies that are pretty obvious and basic, but told in a way that may help people new to them to take notice and properly prioritize.

The nuggets are pretty self-explanatory, things like prepare your morning beforehand, have multiple irons in the fire, follow through, etc are pretty obvious but it's good to have them listed so you can make sure you don't forget one or don't focus on one to the detriment of the others.

The lessons are highlighted, so a skim through it again would probably allow me to list all of them below for useful reference afterwards without needing to read all 191 pages again.

### Chapter 1

Have multiple balls in the air, this way you have things to focus on and you'll never feel like "what's next?". If you know what you want each connection/ball to do, it helps to propel them in the direction you want. You can then spend the same amount of energy manipulating 6 as you do 1 with dramatically more results.
Take initiative, don't wait till a certain arbitrary moment to take action, do it now. Then keep going until it's either done, the other person has indicated they're completely out, or people died. Have confidence and use your own fear of failure to keep yourself going.
A good example he points out is that when you have dedicated time to working, do work. Even if you had expected someone to meet you, you can do other useful work. Spending that time on instagram or other wastes of time adds up and hurts or helps you in the long term.

### Chapter 2

Face-to-face is key to selling but also to getting social credibility. It's easier to understand someone and make a connection in person than over email or text or zoom. Keep your ego in check for the sake of the deal. Turn negative objections into positives (probably helpful to reread Never Split the Difference). Remember that sometimes you are playing by someone else's rules, that's not a negative if you don't let it be.

### Chapter 3

A good quote here to remember is "people don't like being sold, they like shopping with friends". Therefore making a good personal connection and then focusing on what they need to buy/sell is key. Another obvious one to keep in mind: the more people you meet, the more business you'll do. It is a numbers game!

Summing up some key attributes to success:

- You Are Relentless: Relentlessly positive, ready, and quick. Your
  work is your passion and this is evident through every interaction
  you have with clients.
- You Have Empathy: Your ego will not help you close a deal, but
  having empathy will. Buying something is an emotional
  experience. Don’t be afraid to put yourself in their shoes—it
  might be the very thing that helps you close the sale.
- You Are Patient: Be impatient for results, but always be patient
  with your clients.
- You Listen: You don’t just reply, you respond. Learn to let your
  customers talk first. Listen and carefully comprehend what they’re
  saying before giving a thoughtful response.
- You Bring Value: You use your knowledge and expertise about
  your product to help connect a customer with what they want.
- You Have Respect: For your customer, your product, and the
  process. You are honest and authentic in all your actions

### Chapter 4

Serhant likes to harp on his 3 follows: follow up, follow through and follow back. Basically follow up with people so you don't lose momentum, follow through by doing the things you say you'd do (quickly), and then follow back as in check in with folks after the deal to make sure the relationship stays relevant to cash in on referrals. Make sure your follow ups are relevant though. Provide value in each step, don't just email "just checking in on things".

Following through is also a great way to create and them demonstrate accountability. You can dictate the follow through by stating what you'll do and by when, this also allows you to push the deal forward.

### Chapter 5

This chapter focused on dealing with the emotional rollercoaster of clients. It sets out a few ways to deal with it, I think I'll omit it here because I think it is better described in the other books I've read so far.

### Chapter 6

This chapter is about time management, in particular he points out 2 things worth noting. Manage your day by finishing up the last day's work and the tip of getting up early so you can reply to any late emails early (this shows people you are really getting after it). Split your time into 3 categories

1. explicitly book time for finding new work/clients
2. Do your chores - make sure you don't sacrifice all the stuff you need to do on a regular basis for your work. This also serves to help you take a step back and make sure you aren't focusing on the wrong things. This is also good for preparing before you go meet a client so you have done your homework and are (over)prepared for the meeting.
3. Budget time to go do the things you promised clients you'd do. Often times this is the stuff you found in step 1 and budgeted for in step 2.

In an ideal scenario you are spending 50% of your time doing 1, and 25% of your time on the other 2. Don't get sucked into too much step 3, since that will empty out your funnel too fast and you won't have enough balls in the air to act on when this deal finishes or falls through.

### Chapter 7

This chapter focuses on intrinsic motivation. Making sure you know why you chose this job, what you do on a daily basis to grow your business, what you're running from (ie failure condition), what are you doing this for (ie your win condition).

Stay positive, that helps not just yourself but also in your interactions with others. People that are pleasant to be around seem to have better outcomes (think Geutjes).

### Chapter 8

Don't just focus on facts, but tell a story when you are educating someone. When done right, this also helps them visualize their place and how it is relevant to them. This only works if you're a good storyteller AND you know your product/market inside and out.

Be yourself, so also don't hide what makes you different. That will help in establishing your brand and in the long term may keep you saner and surrounded by the people you want to be surrounded by.

### Chapter 9

Sometimes things don't look to be going well. You have options here, if not to close the deal in one fell swoop, you can either get the deal closer incrementally with a counter offer (to keep the conversation going) or find another solution. You can offer to lower your commission to get a deal done (2% of something is better than 3% of nothing). Do set limits though, family time is family time. It's ok to say no sometimes when you have a good reason. Clients will understand that, as long as it's not your go-to answer.

Failures to avoid:

1. You're failing to communicate effectively - either by saying the wrong thing or just not saying something enough.
2. You're replying, not responding - be careful with textual communication since it lacks that personal touch of empathy. People's concerns should be dealt with tactfully.
3. You've set unrealistic expectations - you need to make sure your clients go into every deal and process with realistic expectations. This helps you exceed them but also helps them know what you expect. This goes from the closing process, to the asking price, to your own availability.
4. You don't know your shit (well enough) - nuff said.
5. Your approach is stale - Don't get into a rut, keep challenging yourself and make sure you approach each deal with the enthusiasm it requires.
6. You're overly focused on the money - they're not just clients, they're relationships. The client's experience shouldn't be compromised by your need for a paycheck (that's not their problem and never should become one).

Make sure that even when things seem rough, there's always something you can do.

### Chapter 10

A review of the things covered. A few extra tidbits - use social media, it's free. Try to stand out with your sphere of influence.
