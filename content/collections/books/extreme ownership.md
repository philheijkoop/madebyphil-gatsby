#### By Jocko Willink and Leif Babin

This book is written by two former Navy SEALs turned business consultants. They distill some of the knowledge they learned while in Iraq and that are used to train Navy SEAL leaders into consumable chunks of advice. They're relayed as a story from Iraq, the principle is explicitly stated and then a business context example is given too.

The lessons are divide up into three parts of four chapters each. While they are cloaked in the warrior machoismo, none of the lessons are new. The first part is about the leader's mindset, the second about how to enable team performance, and the last is about sustaining that.

The first part can be readily summarized by explaining the book's title. As in life, a leader is responsible for everything that happens. While you can't control what happens _to_ you, you can control how you respond to those events. Taking this approach to life, and thus also your leadership tasks, helps you feel more in control and reasserts you agency to act to negative effects.

The second part has a lot of parallels in what we see as best practices for successful Agile teams. Keep things simple (KISS), don't spread yourself too thing but focus on doing one thing well before moving on to the next, communicate effectively and make sure the intent is passed down the "chain of command" so you can allow your subordinates to make the correct decisions, and empower your teams to make those decisions and back them up when things don't go as planned.

The final section contains a few more parables that are useful. The usefulness of planning effectively need not be elaborated on here. It is important to manage not just those that are below you in the org chart, but also above. In the face of incomplete information, sometimes any action is better than inaction. Finally a discussion that leadership isn't about controlling everything, sometimes it's about enabling those below you to do their job.

While I enjoyed the book, it is easily digestible, it didn't offer any unique insights. It's probably a good vehicle for people to learn some basic (people) management skills, but not particularly novel.
